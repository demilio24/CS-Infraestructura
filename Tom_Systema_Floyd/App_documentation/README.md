# Systema Floyd, App Documentation

This folder is the canonical reference for every Systema Floyd automation,
script, and data pipeline. It exists so that any operator (human or AI) can pick
up cold and understand exactly how a piece of the system works without having
to reverse-engineer code or trace through GHL workflows.

> **For AI assistants:** Read every file in this folder before making changes
> to any Systema Floyd app. Each doc is self-contained but they reference each
> other where the apps interact (e.g. the registration system writes to sheets
> that the waiver matcher reads, and that the billing dashboard prices).
> Knowing all of them lets you answer cross-cutting questions and avoid
> breaking adjacent systems.

## What's in here

| File | App | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| [registration_system.md](./registration_system.md) | **Registration System + Discrepancy Check** | Full pipeline for Free Camp, Summer Camp, AND After School: parent submits a form on `systemafloyd.com` → GHL routing workflow writes a row in the right Google Sheet → dashboard renders it. Includes the Apps Script failsafe that auto-fixes missed writes for all three forms, with Supabase tombstones, fuzzy-name dedup (catches "Aria" vs "Aria Falzone" as the same kid), cell notes, email alerts that name the failed workflow, and a daily heartbeat-guard that emails if the bot itself goes silent for >24h. After School writes go to the central Main Table (then the School Enrollment Router takes over). |
| [dashboard.md](./dashboard.md) | **Camp Dashboard** (browser + Apps Script) | The staff-facing dashboard at `dashboard/index.html` and the Apps Script `Snapshot.js` pipeline that feeds it. Reads the 4 roster sheets every 5 min, builds `snapshot.json` + history archive + Supabase mirror, and renders KPIs, charts, capacity targets, lunch prep, ops alerts (allergies + data quality), 14-day growth sparkline, and a click-to-expand student roster. |
| [billing_dashboard.md](./billing_dashboard.md) | **Billing Dashboard** (Apps Script) | Sheet-driven billing pipeline: every 5 min, reads the camp + after-school registration sheets, prices each enrollment via the team-editable `Pricing` tab, inflates unit prices with inline tax + processing fee, and diffs against the live Dashboard. Handles cancellations (owed → canceled) and refunds (paid → refund-needed) automatically. Also captures the $1 GHL CC verification fee for audit. |
| [school_enrollment_router.md](./school_enrollment_router.md) | **School Enrollment Router** (Apps Script) | Routes every new student enrollment from a single Main Table into the correct per-school spreadsheet, auto-creating that spreadsheet from a Monthly or Quarterly template the first time it's needed. Defensive against deleted/moved files; uses three-tier name matching (exact → case-insensitive → Levenshtein fuzzy). |
| [camp_day_validator.md](./camp_day_validator.md) | **Camp Day Validator** (browser JS) | Client-side JS pasted into a Custom Code element at the bottom of the GHL summer camp signup form. Keeps the "Select Camp Duration" dropdown in sync with the per-week day checkboxes; blocks form submission until every chosen week has the right number of days ticked. |
| [waiver_matcher.md](./waiver_matcher.md) | **Waiver Matcher** (Apps Script) | Bound to the Waiver APP spreadsheet. On every change, scans every camp roster sheet in Drive, fuzzy-matches student names from waiver rows against camp rows by email + Jaro-Winkler name similarity. Highlights matched cells green and adds health/allergy info as a cell note. |
| [new_forms_spec.md](./new_forms_spec.md) | **New Forms Spec** (Private Lessons, Rent-A-Sensei, Balloons, Birthday Parties, Vladimir Seminar, Teen & Adult Classes) | Per-form field-by-field specification with GHL `dataType`, customer-facing labels, placeholder text, pricing syntax baked into option strings, conditional-display rules, and a build-status snapshot. Includes the live GHL folder + field IDs for Private Lessons (created via API on 2026-05-14) and notes on the GHL custom-fields API quirks discovered during that build (folder shape, picklist `options` must be plain strings, no `objectKey` param, etc.). |
| [forms_todos.md](./forms_todos.md) | **Forms Build TODOs** | Per-form punch list of what's done, what's blocked, and what's needed from Tom for each of the six new forms. Updated as work lands. |
| [navigation.md](./navigation.md) | **Funnel Nav Structure** | Canonical reference for the shared nav bar across all 7 Systema Floyd funnel pages: the 3-category layout (About, Programs ▼, Seminars & Events ▼), dropdown contents, target=_top requirement for breaking out of the GHL iframe, and how to re-run `sf-update-nav.py` to keep the 7 pages in sync. |

## Reading order (for a new contributor)

1. **registration_system.md** first, it's the core of the system and the
   document with the most surface area. Everything else relates to or runs
   alongside it.
2. **camp_day_validator.md** next, it's the front-end gatekeeper that
   produces the form submissions the registration system processes.
3. **dashboard.md**, the operational view of the rosters the registration
   system populates.
4. **billing_dashboard.md**, the financial view of the same rosters,
   pricing each enrollment + handling refunds.
5. **waiver_matcher.md**, runs against the rosters that the registration
   system writes.
6. **school_enrollment_router.md**, separate flow for non-camp school
   enrollments. Same author / pattern, but operates on a different intake.

## Conventions used across all docs

- **Form IDs, sheet IDs, workflow IDs** are listed verbatim so they're
  greppable. Don't paraphrase them.
- **GHL custom field IDs** appear with both the opaque ID and the
  human-readable field name (e.g. `0H3m5fBvXwD3frq75XKa = "Camp Week Choices
  (Free Camp)"`).
- **Configuration constants** are surfaced near the top of each doc so a
  reader can change behavior without spelunking through code.
- **Edge cases** get their own table at the bottom of each doc so future
  contributors can grep for "what happens when X."

## When you change something

If you change behavior in any of these apps, **update the corresponding
doc in the same change**. The docs in this folder ARE the spec. If they drift
from reality, the next person (human or AI) will make incorrect assumptions
and break something.
